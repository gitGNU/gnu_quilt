This is my current list of open issues with the patch scripts. I would
like to do the most intrusive changes before syncing up with the
Savannah CVS. Of course, contributions are very welcome. It wouldn't
hurt to know if you want to work on some of the issues in advance to
avoid duplicate work, though :)

General:

	- Test if patches/ can be moved with environment variable as
	  planned.

	- Abstract backup operations to/from the .pc/ directory, so that
	  optionally something like rcs can be used instead of
	  lib/backup-files?

	- Add something similar to cvs diff, which scans all files for
	  changes that have not been folded back into their patches,
	  similar to:
	  `for p in $(quilt series); do quilt diff -z $p; done'?
	
	- Allow to add a directory? Then we could detect also new files
	  in the directory, without having to add them individually.

	- Instead of passing around and storing in applied-patches the
	  short patch name (=patch file name with .dif .diff .patch .gz
	  .bz2 stripped), translate from short names to real file names
	  an the user interface, and work with full names internally.
	  This will simplify regexp matching in several functions.

	- Support different diff/patch options for different patches.
	  (By specifying them in the series file?)

Documentation:

	- How to rediff with push -f / pop -f?

	- How to import a new version of a patch?

	- How to import a complete directory, before doing
	  wild changes?

quilt refresh:

	- Add an -m option similar to `cvs commit -m "..."' to simplify
	  keeping a change log in the patch documentation?
	
quilt import:

	- Add option to replace the currently applied patch with a new
	  one, by backing out the topmost patch first.

	- Diff -u the documentation of the old and new file, unless one
	  of them is empty. Let the user decide whether to keep the left
	  or the right documentation, or to merge them both. (-d{ona}?)

quilt setup:
	
	- spec2series also prints -p1; omit.

quilt patches:

	- Add something so that it's possible to show a list of all
	  patches, with those patches marked that modify the
	  specified file.

rpatch:

	- If not removing the topmost patch, add checks if any files are
	  hidden by later patches. If so, refuse to remove patch! (Note
	  that poppatch takes care of that currently.)

	- Instead of reverse-applying a patch to make sure it contains all
	  changes, forward-apply it to a copy of the .pc/$patch directory,
	  and check if the resulting files are identical. This also works
	  with patches that don't reverse-apply.

apatch:
	
	- Allow to add a patch in the middle of the applied series, and
	  inject the patch in its proper position in applied-patches.
	  Needs to check if any of the files in the patch are touched by
	  later patches.

quilt diff:

	- The number of contetx lines cannot be overridden in QUILT_DIFF_OPTS:
	  GNU diff uses three context lines as soon as -u or -U3 is on the
	  command line, no matter which order of arguments.
